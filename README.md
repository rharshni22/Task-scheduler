# Task_Scheduler
## Context
The objective of ["Task Scheduling on Flow Networks with Temporal Uncertainty "](http://vigir.missouri.edu/~gdesouza/Research/Conference_CDs/IEEE_SSCI_2007/Foundations%20of%20CI%20-%20FOCI%202007/data/papers/FOCI/S001P019.pdf) is to optimally schedule tasks on a flow network that has temporal uncertainty modeled with interval valued time costs. The fuzzy partial order relation for intervals are used to extend the Edmonds-Karp max-flow min-cost algorithm.
